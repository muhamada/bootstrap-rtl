# Bootstrap 3 RTL Docs

---

This folder contains the same files on [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) website showcasing it but with the addition of bootstrap-rtl.css added.

`components`: Reusable components built to provide iconography, dropdowns, input groups, navigation, alerts, and much more.

`css`: Global CSS settings, fundamental HTML elements styled and enhanced with extensible classes, and an advanced grid system.

`javascript`: Bring Bootstrap's components to life with over a dozen custom jQuery plugins. Easily include them all, or one by one.

`examples`: Basic templates built above Bootstrap to help you start your own project.

`assets` and `dist` are folders used to store files needed for the other folders
